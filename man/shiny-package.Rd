\title{Web Application Framework for R}
\description{
Shiny makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R.
Automatic "reactive" binding between inputs and outputs and extensive
pre-built widgets make it possible to build beautiful, responsive, and
powerful applications with minimal effort.
}
\details{
The Shiny tutorial at \url{http://rstudio.github.com/shiny/tutorial} explains
the framework in depth, walks you through building a simple application, and
includes extensive annotated examples.
