\usage{
renderPlot(expr, width = "auto", height = "auto", res = 72, ...,
  env = parent.frame(), quoted = FALSE, func = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{An expression that generates a plot.}

\item{width,height}{The width/height of the rendered plot, in pixels; or
\code{'auto'} to use the \code{offsetWidth}/\code{offsetHeight} of the HTML
element that is bound to this plot. You can also pass in a function that
returns the width/height in pixels or \code{'auto'}; in the body of the
function you may reference reactive values and functions. When rendering an
inline plot, you must provide numeric values (in pixels) to both
\code{width} and \code{height}.}

\item{res}{Resolution of resulting plot, in pixels per inch. This value is
passed to \code{\link{png}}. Note that this affects the resolution of PNG
rendering in R; it won't change the actual ppi of the browser.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed through to \code{\link[grDevices]{png}}.
These can be used to set the width, height, background color, etc.}

\item{env}{The environment in which to evaluate \code{expr}.}

\item{quoted}{Is \code{expr} a quoted expression (with \code{quote()})? This
is useful if you want to save an expression in a variable.}

\item{func}{A function that generates a plot (deprecated; use \code{expr}
  instead).}
}
\description{
